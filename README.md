## Clean-up oganization To-Do
Since this is just a POC, code is not very well organized and needs to be matured. here is what I see so far:

- [ ] Make JS features optional in settings
- [ ] Move SCSS out of admin.scss into sub components (e.g. navigation, buttons, forms (done), etc.)
- [ ] Move preprocess functions into .inc files and out of .theme
- [ ] Better way to handle Materialize CSS overrides
- [ ] Remove Classy as a parent theme entirely?
- [ ] Prod deployment packaging (Min, optimize, etc)

## Meta

- Icons: currently using font awesome because sass integration allows for simple integration in D8 admin methods -- but looking at google material icons it might work fine -- switch for consistency?

- Grid: Implement a more structure grid system. The template structure in D8 has basically no notion of grid system. I have started to add in Materialize CSS very light grid system but it's awkward.
